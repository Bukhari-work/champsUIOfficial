In an era marked by shifting power dynamics in global health governance including the withdrawal of major actors like the United States from key institutions, the ability to navigate international cooperation, lead across sectors, and negotiate shared solutions has never been more critical.

The **Workshop on Global Health Leadership and Diplomacy (GHLD) – Foundational Level** is designed to introduce participants to the essential principles of diplomacy, negotiation, and leadership in the global health context. This one-day program combines lectures, interactive discussions, and practical exercises, using real-world case studies to explore how global health policies are shaped and how emerging leaders can influence decision-making.
