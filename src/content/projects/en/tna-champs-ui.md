Dear Sir/Madam,

On behalf of the **Center for Health Administration and Policy Studies (CHAMPS), Universitas Indonesia**, we would like to invite you to participate in our **Training Needs Assessment (TNA)** survey.

**CHAMPS UI** is a research and capacity-development center in health systems and policy that collaborates with ministries and government agencies, local governments, health service providers, and development partners to support evidence-based policymaking and institutional strengthening.

Your participation is extremely valuable in ensuring that future CHAMPS UI programs truly respond to institutional needs. As a form of appreciation, **CHAMPS UI will provide mobile credit / communication incentives to 20 selected respondents**.

Thank you very much for your time and contribution.

Sincerely,  
**CHAMPS UI Team**
